# PRODIGY_DS_02

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of the **Titanic dataset**, which contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their survival status, age, gender, class, and more. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, and conduct various analyses to uncover insights into the factors that influenced survival rates.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**
      - The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
      - Initial exploration includes checking the first and last few rows, summary statistics, and data types.

2. **Data Cleaning**
      - Handling missing values in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
      - Removing irrelevant columns such as PassengerId, Name, and Ticket.
      - Checking for duplicates and ensuring data integrity.

3. **Data Analysis**
      - **Survival Rate Distribution:** Analyzing the overall survival rate and visualizing the count of survivors vs. non-survivors.
      - **Passenger Class Distribution:** Exploring the distribution of passengers across different classes and visualizing the data.
      - **Age Distribution:** Summarizing and visualizing the age distribution of passengers.

## Visualizations

Using matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create visualizations that help in understanding the data distribution and relationships between different variables.

## Key Insights
- **Survival Rate:** The overall survival rate is approximately 38.2%, with 61.8% of passengers not surviving.
- **Passenger Class:** The majority of passengers were in the 3rd class, followed by 1st and 2nd classes.
- **Age Distribution:** The average age of passengers is around 29.6 years, with a standard deviation of 12.97 years. The age distribution is visualized using a histogram.

##  Libraries Used
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.        
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** For making attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## Conclusion  
This project successfully performed **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis** on the Titanic dataset. Relationships, patterns, and trends were identified, offering clear insights into passenger survival factors.
